3. **Job Search URL**: Update the `JOB_LINK` in `src/index.ts` with your desired job search criteria:
```typescript
export const DEFINES = {
    JOB_LINK: `https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=4234489284&distance=25&f_AL=true&f_WT=2&geoId=103644278&keywords=senior%20software%20engineer&origin=JOBS_HOME_SEARCH_CARDS`
}
```

4. **Search Parameters**: Modify the URL parameters to match your preferences:

   - Scroll through job listings
   - Apply to jobs with Easy Apply enabled
   - Continue to next pages automatically

## Project Structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts                 # Main entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ functions.ts             # Utility functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ helpers/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ChatGptHelper.ts     # ChatGPT integration for Q&A
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ services/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ApplyService.ts      # Handles job application process
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ JobCardService.ts    # Manages individual job cards
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LinkedInService.ts   # LinkedIn navigation and search
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PuppeteerService.ts  # Browser automation
```

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: Launches a Puppeteer browser instance
2. **Login**: Waits for manual LinkedIn login
3. **Job Search**: Navigates to the specified job search URL
4. **Job Processing**: For each job:
   - Extracts job details (title, description)
   - Checks for Easy Apply button
   - Initiates application process
   - **ü§ñ AI-Powered Form Filling**: When application forms appear:
     - Analyzes each question in the form
     - Combines your personal profile from `about-me.txt`
     - Considers the job description context
     - Uses ChatGPT to generate relevant answers
     - Automatically fills various form fields (text, numbers, dates, selects)
5. **Pagination**: Automatically moves to next page of results
6. **Continuous Operation**: Runs indefinitely until stopped

## Customization

### Modifying Job Search Criteria
Edit the `DEFINES.JOB_LINK` in `src/index.ts` to change:
- Job keywords
- Location
- Experience level
- Work type (remote, hybrid, on-site)
- Date posted

### Customizing AI Responses
- **Personal Profile**: Update `about-me.txt` with your specific information
- **ChatGPT Model**: Change the model in `ChatGptHelper.ts` (default: `gpt-4o-mini`)
- **Response Prompts**: Modify the prompt structure in `ApplyService.ts` for different response styles

### Adding Custom Application Logic
Extend the `ApplyService` class to handle:
- Custom cover letters
- Specialized question answering logic
- Resume file uploads (set `RESUME_PATH` environment variable)
- Custom form field handling

## Troubleshooting

**Browser Issues**:
- Ensure Chrome/Chromium is installed
- Check Puppeteer data directory permissions

**Login Problems**:
- Manually log in when the browser opens
- Check for 2FA requirements

**Application Failures**:
- Some jobs may not have Easy Apply enabled
- Network timeouts may occur with slow connections

**ChatGPT Integration Issues**:
- Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set
- Check OpenAI API quota and billing status
- Update `about-me.txt` with your personal information
- Verify internet connection for API calls

**Configuration Issues**:
- Ensure `about-me.txt` file exists and contains your information
- Check that OpenAI dependency is installed (`npm install openai`)
